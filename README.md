# EE402_Assignment1
To Build this Project you need to have `cmake` & make installed.
This project was developed and built on Linux using cmake 
(with g++ as compiler), so while cmake should ensure that
this code is built successfully on other OS's this hasnt been tested
and your mileage may vary.

## Build Instructions
git clone this repo.  
  
from the project root, `cd` into the build directory
```
cd build
```  
run cmake from build directory on root dir
```
cmake ..
```
This should generate a makefile which you can run via make
```
make
```
This will generate a `yugioh` binary which you can run.
